# To-Do-List_Application
I developed to-do-list app with android for my AP course.

## To do list

My app includes the following sections.
### Mandatory

## Task class
Each task has a Title, a Description, an expiration date and a Boolean indicating whether the task has been completed or not.

## main page
On the main page, there should be a list of tasks and the tasks that have been done are shown in green, by clicking on each task, we go to the details page of that task. Also, on this page, there is a button to add a new task, by pressing it, we go to the "Add Task" page. (Use RecyclerView for the list)

## Add Task page
On this page, you should be able to create a new task and specify its expiration date, name and description, so that it can be added to the list of tasks.

## Task details page
On this page, it should be possible to display the expiration date, name and description of a Task that we clicked on on the main page, and it should be possible to determine whether the Task has been completed.

### Proper object-oriented design

### Proper UI/UX design

## Privileges
* Using fab
* Red the tasks whose expiration date has passed
* Having Splash Screen
* Use Date Picker

### Attention:
The user interface of your program does not have to match the appearance of the example, but it must have the mentioned features.
